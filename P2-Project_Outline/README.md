## Submission Instructions

### Overview

    The Brown Girl Gamer Code (BGGC) page will allow all both members and viewers of the BGGC community to see profiles and content from active members of the Code. It will serve as a landing page to see profiles, social media links, content tags, and schedules to watch live content. The idea came from conversations with members of the BGGC community that I am a part of and wishing for a space where we could see everyone who is actively involved in the Code. It is an important project because discoverability for Black women content creators online can be very difficult, a page like this would aide members of BGGC in developing their content reach online. 

### Features
    Search: Users will be able to search from a list of content tags to discover creators in the community that fit their preferences. 
    Update Profiles: Members will be able to log in and edit their profiles.
    User Logins: Members will be able to create accounts.
    Profiles: On the side of the page, users will be able to select creator name's to see their profile.
### Technologies
    Mongo DB or Firebase
    Angular
